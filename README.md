InspectiveC
======

MobileSubstrate based objc_msgSend hook for debugging/inspection purposes.

Based on itrace by emeau, AspectiveC by saurik, and Subjective-C by kennytm.

This is not compatible with arm64 at the moment, although I do hope to add support in the future.

**(Future) Features:**
* Watch objects
* Watch selectors
* (Hopefully) print arguments

**Usage:**

Modify InspectiveC.plist to choose where to inject InspectiveC.
